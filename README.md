# 🐚 Understanding Shells in Penetration Testing

A **shell** is a program that provides an interface for users (or attackers) to interact with a system by inputting instructions and receiving text-based output.  
In penetration testing and information security, obtaining a shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability to gain interactive access to a host.

## 📌 Types of Shells
- **Bash** – Standard Linux shell, widely used.
- **Zsh** – Feature-rich shell, extension of Bash.
- **cmd** – Windows command-line interpreter.
- **PowerShell** – Windows task automation and configuration shell.

## 🎯 Why Get a Shell?

A shell provides direct access to:
- The **Operating System**, **system commands**, and the **file system**.
- Post-exploitation steps such as **enumeration**, **privilege escalation**, **pivoting**, **file transfer**, and more.
- Faster usage of attack tools and **data exfiltration**.
- **Persistence mechanisms** to maintain access.
- A **stealthier** interface compared to graphical shells, with easier automation.

## 🔑 How to Get a Shell

### 1. Payloads Deliver the Shell
A **payload** can be defined in different contexts:
- **Networking** – Reverse shells, bind shells, web shells.
- **Basic Computing** – Scripts or executables that execute commands.
- **Programming** – Code snippets leveraging vulnerabilities.
- **Exploitation & Security** – Payloads crafted for specific exploits (Metasploit, custom exploits).
