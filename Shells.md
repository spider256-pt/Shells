- A Shell is a program that provides a computer user with an interface to input instructions into the system and view text output:
	- Bash
	- Zsh
	- cmd
	- PowerShell
- As penetration tester and information security professional, a shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to host.

- ## Why get a Shell:

	- A shell gives a direct access to the `OS`, `System commands` and `file system`.
	- After getting access, the next step is to enumeration the system vectors that may allow to escalate privileges, pivot, transfer files and more.
	- Here we will cover the next step after enumeration and identification of promising exploits. 
	-  Shell can make it easier to use the attack tool, exfiltrate data, gather, store and document all the details of the attack.
	- Shell allows us to maintain persistence on the system.
	- Benefit of shell its harder to detect than `graphical shells`, `faster to navigate the OS`, and `easier to automate the actions`


- ### How to get a Shell:
	- #### Payloads Delivers the Shell:
		- A `payload` can be defined in few different ways:
			- Networking
			- Basic Computing
			- Programming 
			- Exploitation & Security
